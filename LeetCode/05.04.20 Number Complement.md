## Question
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 

Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

### The First Solution
```
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        
        result = []
        #Find Binary number, and get its Complement
        while num > 1:
            res = num % 2
            num = int(num/2)
            result.append(1-res)
        
        result.append(0) #The highest number is 0.
        
        po = len(result)-1
        flip_num = 0
        for i in list(reversed(result)): #Reverse to the right sequence of complement
            
            flip_num += 2**po*i
            po-=1
        print(result)
        return(flip_num)
```

### The Best Solution
```
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        b_str = bin(num).replace('0b', '') #Get Binary number
        mask_str = ''.join(['1'] * len(b_str)) #Get mod
        return num ^ int(mask_str, 2) #a mod b
 ```
 ### Beautiful Solution (But not Runtime Best)
 ```
 class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        return num^(2**(len(bin(num)[2:]))-1)
```
